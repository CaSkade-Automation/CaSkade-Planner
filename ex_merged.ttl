Due to open world assumption (OWA) the case that more than one In- or Outputs occur does always mean an alternative Input. For the case, that In- and Outputs are depending on each other, the ObjectProperty Dependency can be used. It can be interpreted as an \"AND\" constructor between In- and/or Outputs of a process.

E.g.: A process has two Inputs. If they are alternatives, then this fact must not  be explcitly modelled. If both Inputs have to go into the process, then the \"Dependency\" ObjectProperty is assigned between them.

More complex example: Input A and B have to go into a process, while Input C and D are alternatives for A and B. The Inputs have to go as groups in the process. This equals: A AND B OR C AND D. The Dependency Operator is used between A and B as well as between C and D.

Furthermore, the Operator can be used to express dependencies between In- and Outputs. If A and B are alternative Inputs that result in the Ouputs C for A or D for B then this equals: A AND C or D AND B. The ObjectProperty can be used between both, In- and/or Outputs."""@en .

This is typically used for routine machine conditions that requires minor operator servicing to continue production. This state can be initiated automatically or by an operator and can be easily recovered from. An example of this would be a machine that requires an operator to periodically refill a glue dispenser or carton magazine and due to the machine design, these operations cannot be performed while the machine is running. Since these types of tasks are normal production operations, it is not desirable to go through aborting or stopping sequences, and because these functions are integral to the machine they are not considered to be \"external\". While in the HOLDING state, the machine is typically brought to a controlled stop and then transitions to HELD upon state complete. To be able to restart production correctly after the HELD state, all relevant process set-points and return status of the procedures at the time of receiving the HOLD command must be saved in the machine controller when executing the HOLDING procedure.

Second, SWRL rules are used to check the constency aspects that cannot be modelled through class expressions. These rules infer 4 \"Overall_X_Constent\" DataProperties. For the case that incremental rules were possible, other consistency attributes are inferred, so that in case of inconsistency a debugging can be started.

Explanation to class expressions in relation to DIN61360 definitions:

\"exactly\" is used for \"necessary\" (zwingend)
\"max\" is used for \"optinal\" (wahlfrei) with maximum restriction

If something is just \"optional\", it will not occur in the class expression.

     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

This CD is motivated in part by a desire to maintain compatibility
with the MathML semantics element,

In order for it to be possible for OpenMath to express symbols in an
alternative encoding (this facilitates the exact translation and
representation of objects) we use the OpenMath attribution nodes
(which performs a similar role to the MathML semantics nodes). The
formats and descriptions of common syntaxes are held in this CD; at
present this only includes LaTeX and MathML.""" ;

symbols together with the alternative encoding placed in a string.
The string encoding must be valid XML, and so non-XML valid characters
must themselves be encoded as suggested in \"Draft of the OpenMath
Standard\".

For alternative encodings to be represented in OpenMath, one must
define a symbol to describe the encoding.""" ,

cycles of length 0 or 1 do not occur in permutations.

When viewed as the set of cycles which are its arguments, the symbol
permutation has a normal form constructor.

All symbols defined in this CD may appear as the head of an
application.  For such symbols, we distinguish between functions and
constructors.  A function is thought of as a mathematical function,
which can be evaluated on its arguments, a constructor uses its
arguments as fields of a structure. (In principle, the arguments of a constructor should
be accessible; we have not introduced separate symbols to enable
access because the `destruction' of the mathematical object can take place in phrasebooks.)

The constructors in this CD are cycle, permutation, list_perm, and endomap.

The operations inverse, left_compose, right_compose are also defined
in this CD, although the most general purpose version already occurs
in fns1, fns2. The reasons is two-fold: first, strictly
speaking, our permutations are not maps, and so these notions havfe to
redefined.  A more practical reason is that with dynamical loading, it
is easier to encode and decode a new symbol in the CD at hand rather
than a symbol in a CD that is previously dealt with.

Revision 0.2: added endomap. Help of Henny Wilbrink.""" ;

 polynomials. There are many possible choices for a polynomial CD, and
 several questions to answer. 

 The reader may feel that this content dictionary is quite different in
 spirit from the \"Basic\" one. Although it basically defines a set of concepts
 related to polynomials (such as degree, factorization, resultant...), there
 are two new points here:
 - a certain emphasis on representation issues (including structural
   constraints on some OM objects),
 - an attempt to specify some \"computational behaviour\" of an OM application
   that handles (part of) this CD.
 
 As some people may disagree with some of our choices, we will try to justify
 them in this rather long foreword. 
 
 1. Representation issues

 One of the interest of OM is certainly to enable the use of specialized
 servers. It is important to promote the writing of OM-compliant servers by
 placing as few constraints as possible on the programmers of these
 packages. This CD has been designed with the idea that it could be simple to
 use for a server dealing only with polynomial computations. Hence we have
 used a particular representation for polynomials (distributed with dense
 monomials). This representation is rather abstract in the sense that it does
 not introduce names for variables. It explicitly contains the polynomial
 ring a polynomial belongs to as the set of the coefficients and the number
 of variables. It seems (from our experience) that this information is
 necessary for most specialized servers. 

 Expressing constraints on the structure of OM objects made from the symbols
 in this CD is not always easy. One of the main reason is that a symbol such
 as \"gcd\" is meant to denote the GCD of a set of polynomials, no matter how
 the polynomials are represented. Such a function should thus accept both
 \"symbolic\" arguments (a list of symbolic object meant to be polynomials) and
 the polynomials in the specific representation defined in this CD. Of
 course, another solution will be to have one \"gcd\" for one (or several)
 particular representation and another \"gcd\" to express the general notion
 of polynomial \"gcd\". We though that the solution we chose was more in the
 spirit of \"Basic\" and the discussions of the last OpenMath meeting.

 A question which is not entirely answered is whether or not it is
 interesting to have \"symbolic\" objects inside some constructors (such as a
 power which is not an OM integer in \"Monom\" or a symbolic \"PolyRingD\" (a
 variable) as an argument of \"DMP\"). We explicitly forbid that in the first
 version of this CD.

 Note that we did not try to express the constraints with signatures in this
 version because we did not find a really satisfactory solution.

 2. Specifying some \"computational behaviour\"

 Of course it would be of no use to exactly specify the behaviour of any OM
 application that receives an OM object. There are (at least) two reasons for
 that:
 - an OM object is intended to represent a mathematical object and thus the
   same OM object could be sent to a typesetter as well as to a symbolic
   computation system,
 - even when dealing with programs that compute, exact specifications could be
   impossible or too much constraining for a given system.

 On the other hand, we believe that one of the goal of OM is certainly that a
 program needing to factorize an integer could transparently use Maple, Axiom
 or Pari to do the job. This is of course possible only if all severs that
 \"implement\" (in the sense of really performing) the mathematical notion of
 integer factorization answer in a similar way. In other words, we should not
 hesitate to specify what a particulary useful class of OM applications (the
 \"computing\" ones) should return (the form of the result) everytime
 compliance to this specification is simple enough because it is obviously
 very useful. We have tried to express this idea in this CD through some
 comments and the use of symbols such as \"factored\" or \"groebnered\" that
 describe the required results of some functions. 
 
 The general \"compliance\" rule can be stated as:
   an OM application that understands this CD and implements some of the 
   polynomials operation described is required to implement them using the
   constructors defined in this CD, as indicated in the comments associated
   with the operations.

 This means that if the OM version of a computer algebra system claims to
 implement polynomial factorization, another application can send him an
 OM object as described in the \"factor\" comment (the symbol \"factor\" applied
 to one argument, a DMP) and the result will be return as defined : a 
 \"factored\" symbol whose arguments are described in the corresponding entry
 of the poly CD.""" ,

Conway polynomials were defined by R. Parker. Their purpose is to
provide a standard notation for elements in a finite field
GF(p^n) with p^n elements, p being a prime.

This is for example used within computer algebra systems to have data
of finite field elements which can easily be ported between different
programs.
 
The Conway polynomials are also used in data bases like the Modular
Atlas character tables, this was the original motivation for their
definition.
 
The computation method of computing the minimal polynomials of all
compatible elements was rediscovered in

L.S.Heath and N.A.Loehr, <em>New algorithms for generating Conway
polynomials over finite fields</em>, Proceedings of the Tenth Annual
ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (Baltimore, MD, 1999),
429--437, ACM, New York (1999)

There are basically two methods to compute Conway polynomials.

The first is to run through all polynomials of degree n over GF(p)
with respect to the ordering defined above and to check the necessary
conditions (for primitivity one has to check that for each proper
(maximal) divisor k of p^n-1 we have that f_{p,n}(X)
does not divide X^k-1).

The second possibility is to take any representation of
GF(p^n) and to enumerate all elements in that field which
fulfill the compatibility condition 3. above. Then check for each of
these elements if it is primitive and if yes compute its minimal
polynomial over GF(p). The smallest polynomial found this way is the
Conway polynomial.

Both methods were used by R. Parker to compute a long list of Conway
polynomials. These are available in computer algebra systems like <a
href=\"http://www.gap-system.org\">GAP</a> or <a
href=\"http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/magma/\">Magma</a> and they
are used in several other programs, like the <a

If G has n conjugacy classes then:

[p1, .., pk] i < j implies that pi < pj and 
the pi are precisely the primes which divide the order of 
some centralizer of a conjugacy class

* centralizer_indices is of the form 
[[i11, ...,i1k] ... [in1,...ink]]
so the centralizer of class 1 has order p1^i11 ... pk^i1k etc

* classnames is a list of n strings which name the conjugacy classes
in line with the convention used in the Atlas of Finite Groups

* power_map is of the form [list1, ..., listk]
where listi[j] is the name of the class where elements of class j go when
raised to the power pi.

columns are conjugacy classes. Entries are the value of an element of the

T being true. 

This means f_T is in the radical ideal of ideal(C)[bound variables].

f_T is nonzero. In other words, for all parameter choices of a
