Due to open world assumption (OWA) the case that more than one In- or Outputs occur does always mean an alternative Input. For the case, that In- and Outputs are depending on each other, the ObjectProperty Dependency can be used. It can be interpreted as an \"AND\" constructor between In- and/or Outputs of a process.r
r
E.g.: A process has two Inputs. If they are alternatives, then this fact must not  be explcitly modelled. If both Inputs have to go into the process, then the \"Dependency\" ObjectProperty is assigned between them.r
r
More complex example: Input A and B have to go into a process, while Input C and D are alternatives for A and B. The Inputs have to go as groups in the process. This equals: A AND B OR C AND D. The Dependency Operator is used between A and B as well as between C and D.r
r
Furthermore, the Operator can be used to express dependencies between In- and Outputs. If A and B are alternative Inputs that result in the Ouputs C for A or D for B then this equals: A AND C or D AND B. The ObjectProperty can be used between both, In- and/or Outputs."""@en .

This is typically used for routine machine conditions that requires minor operator servicing to continue production. This state can be initiated automatically or by an operator and can be easily recovered from. An example of this would be a machine that requires an operator to periodically refill a glue dispenser or carton magazine and due to the machine design, these operations cannot be performed while the machine is running. Since these types of tasks are normal production operations, it is not desirable to go through aborting or stopping sequences, and because these functions are integral to the machine they are not considered to be \"external\". While in the HOLDING state, the machine is typically brought to a controlled stop and then transitions to HELD upon state complete. To be able to restart production correctly after the HELD state, all relevant process set-points and return status of the procedures at the time of receiving the HOLD command must be saved in the machine controller when executing the HOLDING procedure.r

arguments as fields of a structure. (In principle, the arguments of a constructor shouldr
be accessible; we have not introduced separate symbols to enabler
access because the `destruction' of the mathematical object can take place in phrasebooks.)r

speaking, our permutations are not maps, and so these notions havfe tor
redefined.  A more practical reason is that with dynamical loading, itr
is easier to encode and decode a new symbol in the CD at hand ratherr

 polynomials. There are many possible choices for a polynomial CD, andr
 several questions to answer. r
r
 The reader may feel that this content dictionary is quite different inr
 spirit from the \"Basic\" one. Although it basically defines a set of conceptsr
 related to polynomials (such as degree, factorization, resultant...), therer
 are two new points here:r
 - a certain emphasis on representation issues (including structuralr
   constraints on some OM objects),r
 - an attempt to specify some \"computational behaviour\" of an OM applicationr
   that handles (part of) this CD.r
 r
 As some people may disagree with some of our choices, we will try to justifyr
 them in this rather long foreword. r
 r
 1. Representation issuesr
r
 One of the interest of OM is certainly to enable the use of specializedr
 servers. It is important to promote the writing of OM-compliant servers byr
 placing as few constraints as possible on the programmers of theser
 packages. This CD has been designed with the idea that it could be simple tor
 use for a server dealing only with polynomial computations. Hence we haver
 used a particular representation for polynomials (distributed with denser
 monomials). This representation is rather abstract in the sense that it doesr
 not introduce names for variables. It explicitly contains the polynomialr
 ring a polynomial belongs to as the set of the coefficients and the numberr
 of variables. It seems (from our experience) that this information isr
 necessary for most specialized servers. r
r
 Expressing constraints on the structure of OM objects made from the symbolsr
 in this CD is not always easy. One of the main reason is that a symbol suchr
 as \"gcd\" is meant to denote the GCD of a set of polynomials, no matter howr
 the polynomials are represented. Such a function should thus accept bothr
 \"symbolic\" arguments (a list of symbolic object meant to be polynomials) andr
 the polynomials in the specific representation defined in this CD. Ofr
 course, another solution will be to have one \"gcd\" for one (or several)r
 particular representation and another \"gcd\" to express the general notionr
 of polynomial \"gcd\". We though that the solution we chose was more in ther
 spirit of \"Basic\" and the discussions of the last OpenMath meeting.r
r
 A question which is not entirely answered is whether or not it isr
 interesting to have \"symbolic\" objects inside some constructors (such as ar
 power which is not an OM integer in \"Monom\" or a symbolic \"PolyRingD\" (ar
 variable) as an argument of \"DMP\"). We explicitly forbid that in the firstr
 version of this CD.r
r
 Note that we did not try to express the constraints with signatures in thisr
 version because we did not find a really satisfactory solution.r
r
 2. Specifying some \"computational behaviour\"r
r
 Of course it would be of no use to exactly specify the behaviour of any OMr
 application that receives an OM object. There are (at least) two reasons forr
 that:r
 - an OM object is intended to represent a mathematical object and thus ther
   same OM object could be sent to a typesetter as well as to a symbolicr
   computation system,r
 - even when dealing with programs that compute, exact specifications could ber
   impossible or too much constraining for a given system.r
r
 On the other hand, we believe that one of the goal of OM is certainly that ar
 program needing to factorize an integer could transparently use Maple, Axiomr
 or Pari to do the job. This is of course possible only if all severs thatr
 \"implement\" (in the sense of really performing) the mathematical notion ofr
 integer factorization answer in a similar way. In other words, we should notr
 hesitate to specify what a particulary useful class of OM applications (ther
 \"computing\" ones) should return (the form of the result) everytimer
 compliance to this specification is simple enough because it is obviouslyr
 very useful. We have tried to express this idea in this CD through somer
 comments and the use of symbols such as \"factored\" or \"groebnered\" thatr
 describe the required results of some functions. r
 r
 The general \"compliance\" rule can be stated as:r
   an OM application that understands this CD and implements some of the r
   polynomials operation described is required to implement them using ther
   constructors defined in this CD, as indicated in the comments associatedr
   with the operations.r
r
 This means that if the OM version of a computer algebra system claims tor
 implement polynomial factorization, another application can send him anr
 OM object as described in the \"factor\" comment (the symbol \"factor\" appliedr
 to one argument, a DMP) and the result will be return as defined : a r
 \"factored\" symbol whose arguments are described in the corresponding entryr
 of the poly CD.""" ,

   polynomials operation described is required to implement them using ther
   constructors defined in this CD, as indicated in the comments associatedr
   with the operations.r
r
 This means that if the OM version of a computer algebra system claims tor
 implement polynomial factorization, another application can send him anr
 OM object as described in the \"factor\" comment (the symbol \"factor\" appliedr
 to one argument, a DMP) and the result will be return as defined: a r
 \"factored\" symbol whose arguments are described in the corresponding entryr
 of the poly CD.""" .

Conway polynomials were defined by R. Parker. Their purpose is tor
provide a standard notation for elements in a finite fieldr
GF(p^n) with p^n elements, p being a prime.r
r
This is for example used within computer algebra systems to have datar
of finite field elements which can easily be ported between differentr
programs.r
 r
The Conway polynomials are also used in data bases like the Modularr
Atlas character tables, this was the original motivation for theirr
definition.r
 r
The computation method of computing the minimal polynomials of allr
compatible elements was rediscovered inr
r
L.S.Heath and N.A.Loehr, <em>New algorithms for generating Conwayr
polynomials over finite fields</em>, Proceedings of the Tenth Annualr
ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (Baltimore, MD, 1999),r
429--437, ACM, New York (1999)r
r
There are basically two methods to compute Conway polynomials.r
r
The first is to run through all polynomials of degree n over GF(p)r
with respect to the ordering defined above and to check the necessaryr
conditions (for primitivity one has to check that for each properr
(maximal) divisor k of p^n-1 we have that f_{p,n}(X)r
does not divide X^k-1).r
r
The second possibility is to take any representation ofr
GF(p^n) and to enumerate all elements in that field whichr
fulfill the compatibility condition 3. above. Then check for each ofr
these elements if it is primitive and if yes compute its minimalr
polynomial over GF(p). The smallest polynomial found this way is ther
Conway polynomial.r
r
Both methods were used by R. Parker to compute a long list of Conwayr
polynomials. These are available in computer algebra systems like <ar
href=\"http://www.gap-system.org\">GAP</a> or <ar
href=\"http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/magma/\">Magma</a> and theyr
are used in several other programs, like the <ar
